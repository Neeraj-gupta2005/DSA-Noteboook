# DSA-Notebook

Welcome to the DSA Notebook repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Each file in this repository will contain detailed information about the DSA questions I have worked on.

## Repository Structure

- **Daily Files**: Each day, I will create a new file that documents the DSA questions I've solved. Each file will include:
  - **Problem Statement**: Description of the problem.
  - **Brute Force Solution**: Initial, less efficient approach to solving the problem.
  - **Better Solution**: An improved approach that is more efficient than the brute force method.
  - **Optimal Solution**: The most efficient approach with the best time and space complexity.

## Example File Structure

Each file will follow this structure:

### Problem Statement

### Brute Force Solution

### Better Solution (if any)

### Optimal solution
